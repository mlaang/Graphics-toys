## Sphere raytracer

The sphere raytracer, a running version of which can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsBBzV) is a small raytracer focused on spheres; although there is also a plane involved. It uses some extra tricks to allow spheres to be subtracted from each other, which is how the concave surfaces on the central sphere in the image below are created.
