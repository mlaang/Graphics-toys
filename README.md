Diverse small programs relating to graphics

## Sphere raytracer

The sphere raytracer, a version of which runs in the browser can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsBBzV) is a small raytracer focused on spheres; although there is also a plane involved. It uses some extra tricks to allow spheres to be subtracted from each other, which is how the concave surfaces on the central sphere in the image below are created.

## Hyperboloid of revolution

A small program that draws animated hyperboloids of revolution, a version of which runs in the browser can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wdSBRt). Hyperboloids of revolution can be viewed as the surface consisting of a the set of circles in the plane orthogonal to a line which pass through another, given line. This is not how they're usually defined, although it is equivalent to the conventional definition and is a shorter description, which incidentally allows them to be drawn easily.

## Refraction in the sphere raytracer

An extension of the sphere raytracer with refraction added. A version of it running in the browser can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tt2cD3). It's somewhat less harmonious than the original.
